# These extensions are added when 'ca' signs a request.

# Important explanation:
#
# Mailservers usually include SMTP daemons. SMTP servers act as server and
# client because they work in a hierarchy. Some server softwares like sendmail
# require that the SMTP server identifies itself as a SMTP client if it contacts
# another SMTP server. Usually you only want to issue one certificate per server
# and not one certificate per service and therefore you have to set the
# extensions for SSL Client and SSL Server like recommended by OpenSSL (please
# see "man x509" after you installed OpenSSL)

# This goes against PKIX guidelines but some CAs do it and some software
# requires this to avoid interpreting an end user certificate as a CA.

basicConstraints=CA:FALSE

# Here are some examples of the usage of nsCertType. If it is omitted
# the certificate can be used for anything *except* object signing.

# For an object signing certificate this would be used.
#nsCertType = objsign

# For normal client use this is typical
nsCertType = client, server

# This is typical also
